      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Noah Scott and I am a programmer with experience in Python, Java, and C++. I also have a basic knowledge of web development.
        I have always been interested in technology and programming, and I enjoy learning new programming languages and technologies in my free time. I believe that continuous learning is crucial in this field, and I am always eager to expand my skills and knowledge.
        In my previous projects, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from simple command-line applications to web applications. I am a fast learner and enjoy tackling new challenges and problems.
        I am looking for opportunities where I can gain practical experience and continue to grow as a programmer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
